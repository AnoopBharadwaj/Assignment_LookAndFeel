                                    iOS, a system Apple developed specifically for Apple's own mobile devices in 2007, has been available for iPhone and iPad. The first iOS was designed for Apple's first generation of mobile phones. It is this extraordinary system that has made the mobile phone industry a revolutionary development, and that even has allowed Apple to surpass the once-dominant handset industry.

                                    Android, a system developed by Andy Rubin in 2003 and later acquired by Google in 2005, has seen dramatic improvements since 2007, making it known worldwide. Today, the development ofAndroid system is based on Linux. The initial version of the interface is too simple, and some details are modeled on iOS, such as the function of sliding to unlock. Steve Jobs wasalso so rampant with Google and repeated lawsuits to destroy it, but eventually failed. After several years of continuous improvements in its operation, interface, details and otheraspects, with the addition of the advantages of open source systems, it ultimately defeated Symbian as the dominant mobile phone system.

                                    The biggest difference between them is the closed source system and open source system. iOS is a closed source system, which means that no one except Apple can use it privately, andthat there is merely the official version of the system. And Android is an open source system, which means that anyone can use and modify it. Therefore, Android has a lot of goodrevisions, such as CM, MIUI, etc., and any mobile phone manufacturers can use the Android system.
